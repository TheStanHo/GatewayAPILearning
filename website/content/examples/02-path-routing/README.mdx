This page contains examples demonstrating different path matching strategies in Gateway API: prefix matching, exact matching, and multiple path rules.

## Path Matching Types

Gateway API supports three types of path matching:

1. **PathPrefix** - Matches any path that starts with the specified prefix
2. **Exact** - Matches only the exact path specified
3. **RegularExpression** - Matches paths using regular expressions (not shown in these examples)

## Examples

### Path Prefix Matching

PathPrefix matches any path that starts with the specified prefix. This is the most common type of path matching.

<CodeBlock filename="httproute-path-prefix.yaml" />

**Key Points:**
- Matches: `/api`, `/api/`, `/api/v1`, `/api/users/123`
- Doesn't match: `/apis`, `/apiary`
- Use this for routing API endpoints, static file paths, or any hierarchical path structure

### Exact Path Matching

Exact matches only the exact path specified. Useful for health checks, metrics endpoints, or specific routes.

<CodeBlock filename="httproute-path-exact.yaml" />

**Key Points:**
- Matches: `/health` (exactly)
- Doesn't match: `/health/`, `/health/check`, `/healthcheck`
- Use this when you need precise path matching without any sub-paths

### Multiple Path Rules

Shows how to route different paths to different services. Rules are evaluated in order - first match wins.

<CodeBlock filename="httproute-multiple-paths.yaml" />

**Key Points:**
- Rules are evaluated in order (top to bottom)
- More specific paths should come before less specific ones
- The catch-all rule (`/`) should be last
- Each rule can route to different backend services

## Ingress Equivalent

For comparison, here's the equivalent Nginx Ingress configuration:

<CodeBlock filename="ingress-path-equivalent.yaml" />

## Best Practices

1. **Order Matters**: Place more specific paths before less specific ones
2. **Use PathPrefix for APIs**: Most API routes benefit from prefix matching
3. **Use Exact for Specific Endpoints**: Health checks, metrics, and webhooks often need exact matching
4. **Catch-All Last**: Always place the default/catch-all rule (`/`) at the end
5. **Test Path Matching**: Verify that your paths match as expected, especially with trailing slashes
