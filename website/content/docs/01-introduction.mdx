# Introduction to Gateway API

## What is Gateway API?

Gateway API is the **next-generation standard** for Kubernetes service networking. It's designed to replace and improve upon the Ingress resource, providing a more expressive, extensible, and role-oriented model for managing traffic in Kubernetes clusters.

Think of Gateway API as the evolution of Ingress Controllers - it solves many of the limitations that Ingress resources have, especially when using Nginx Ingress Controllers.

## Why Gateway API Exists

### ⚠️ Important: Ingress NGINX Retirement

**Kubernetes SIG Network has announced the retirement of Ingress NGINX.** According to the [official announcement](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/11/11/ingress-nginx-retirement/):

- **Best-effort maintenance** will continue until **March 2026**
- After March 2026, there will be **no further releases, bugfixes, or security updates**
- **SIG Network recommends migrating to Gateway API** or another Ingress controller immediately

This retirement announcement underscores the importance of learning Gateway API now. Gateway API is not just an improvement over Ingress—it's the **recommended path forward** for Kubernetes networking.

> **Why is Ingress NGINX being retired?** The project has struggled with insufficient maintainership for years, with only one or two people doing development work in their spare time. Despite its popularity, the technical debt and security concerns (such as arbitrary NGINX configuration via annotations) have become insurmountable. Gateway API represents the modern, secure, and maintainable approach to Kubernetes networking.

### Limitations of Ingress Controllers (Nginx Ingress)

If you've worked with Nginx Ingress Controllers, you've likely encountered these challenges:

1. **Single Resource for Everything**: All configuration goes into one `Ingress` resource
2. **Vendor-Specific Annotations**: Advanced features require Nginx-specific annotations like:
   - `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target`
   - `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary`
   - `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rate-limit`
3. **Limited Role Separation**: Infrastructure and application teams often need to modify the same resource
4. **Portability Issues**: Annotations don't work across different Ingress implementations
5. **Limited Expressiveness**: Hard to express complex routing rules, traffic splitting, and policies

### How Gateway API Solves These Problems

Gateway API addresses these limitations by:

1. **Role-Oriented Design**: Separates infrastructure (Gateway) from application (HTTPRoute) concerns
2. **Standardized API**: Works across different implementations (Nginx, Istio, Contour, etc.)
3. **More Expressive**: Native support for advanced routing, traffic splitting, and policies
4. **Extensible**: Policy attachments and extension points for custom features
5. **Multi-Protocol**: Supports HTTP, TCP, UDP, and TLS routing

## Architecture Comparison

The diagram below shows a side-by-side comparison of Nginx Ingress Controller (traditional approach) and Gateway API (modern approach). This visual comparison highlights the key architectural differences and improvements.

**Key Differences:**

- **Nginx Ingress**: Uses a single `Ingress` resource with vendor-specific annotations
- **Gateway API**: Separates concerns with `Gateway` (infrastructure) and `HTTPRoute` (application)

*See the interactive diagram below for a visual comparison.*

## Key Benefits

### 1. Role Separation

**Nginx Ingress:**
- Both infrastructure and application teams modify the same `Ingress` resource
- Can lead to conflicts and permission issues

**Gateway API:**
- Infrastructure team manages `Gateway` (ports, TLS, infrastructure)
- Application team manages `HTTPRoute` (routing rules, backends)
- Clear separation of concerns

### 2. Portability

**Nginx Ingress:**
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rate-limit: "100"
```
These annotations only work with Nginx Ingress!

**Gateway API:**
```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
spec:
  filters:
    - type: URLRewrite
```
This works with any Gateway API implementation!

### 3. Better Expressiveness

**Nginx Ingress:**
- Traffic splitting requires canary annotations
- Header-based routing needs complex annotations
- Limited support for advanced matching

**Gateway API:**
- Native weighted routing in `backendRefs`
- Built-in header, query parameter, and method matching
- Rich filter system for request/response modifications

## When to Use Gateway API vs Ingress

### Use Gateway API When:
- ✅ **You're using Ingress NGINX** (retiring March 2026 - migration recommended)
- ✅ You need advanced routing features (traffic splitting, header matching)
- ✅ You want portability across different implementations
- ✅ You have multiple teams (infrastructure vs application)
- ✅ You need fine-grained policy control
- ✅ You're starting a new project
- ✅ You want a future-proof solution with active development

### Use Ingress When:
- ⚠️ **Only if you're using a non-NGINX Ingress controller** that will continue to be maintained
- ⚠️ Your cluster doesn't support Gateway API yet (consider upgrading)
- ⚠️ You have simple routing needs and are using a maintained Ingress controller

> **Note**: If you're currently using Ingress NGINX, you should plan to migrate to Gateway API before March 2026. SIG Network recommends Gateway API as the preferred migration path.

## Gateway API Versions

Gateway API has evolved through several versions:

### v1alpha2 (Early)
- Initial experimental release
- Basic routing features
- Limited implementation support

### v1beta1 (Stable Beta)
- More stable API
- Better implementation support
- Common features standardized

### v1 (Current Stable)
- Production-ready
- Core features are stable
- Widely supported by implementations

**Note**: Always check which version your Gateway API implementation supports. Most modern implementations support v1beta1 or v1.

## Implementation Providers

Gateway API is a **standard**, not a specific implementation. You can use it with:

- **Nginx Gateway Fabric**: Nginx's official Gateway API implementation
- **Istio**: Service mesh with Gateway API support
- **Contour**: Envoy-based Gateway API implementation
- **Kong**: API gateway with Gateway API support
- **Traefik**: Cloud-native router with Gateway API support
