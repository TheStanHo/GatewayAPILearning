# Gateway API Examples

This page contains working YAML examples for Gateway API, organized by topic. Each example includes comments and references to the corresponding documentation.

## Example Categories

Browse examples by category below. Each category contains working YAML files that you can apply directly to your Kubernetes cluster.

The examples are organized by topic, from basic setup to advanced routing patterns. Each example includes:
- ✅ Working YAML configuration
- ✅ Comments explaining key fields  
- ✅ References to related documentation
- ✅ Nginx Ingress equivalents for comparison

## How to Use These Examples

1. **Read the Documentation First**: Each example folder references documentation that explains the concepts
2. **Review the YAML**: Each file includes comments explaining key fields
3. **Compare with Ingress**: Many examples include Nginx Ingress equivalents
4. **Adapt to Your Needs**: Modify examples to match your use case
5. **Test in Your Cluster**: Apply examples to your Kubernetes cluster (with Gateway API installed)

## ⚠️ Prerequisites

<Alert type="important" title="IMPORTANT: Install Gateway API CRDs First!">
Before using any of these examples, you **must** install the Gateway API Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) in your Kubernetes cluster. Gateway API resources are not part of standard Kubernetes.
</Alert>

### 1. Install Gateway API CRDs

```powershell
# Option 1: From NGINX Gateway Fabric (recommended if using NGINX)
kubectl kustomize "https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/config/crd/gateway-api/standard?ref=v2.2.1" | kubectl apply -f -

# Option 2: From Official Gateway API Repository
kubectl kustomize "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v2.2.1/standard-install.yaml" | kubectl apply -f -
```

### 2. Verify CRDs are Installed

```powershell
kubectl get crd | Select-String gateway
```

You should see CRDs like `gatewayclasses.gateway.networking.k8s.io`, `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io`, and `httproutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io`.

### 3. Install a Gateway API Implementation

Choose and install a Gateway API implementation:

- **NGINX Gateway Fabric** (recommended for this guide):
  ```powershell
  helm install ngf oci://ghcr.io/nginx/charts/nginx-gateway-fabric --create-namespace -n nginx-gateway
  ```

- **Other options:** Istio, Contour, Kong, Traefik (see their respective documentation)

### Additional Requirements

- Kubernetes cluster (minikube, kind, or cloud cluster)
- `kubectl` installed and configured
- `helm` 3.0+ (for NGINX Gateway Fabric installation)

For detailed setup instructions, see the [NGINX Gateway Fabric Installation Guide](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/installation/) or the [Core Concepts documentation](/docs/02-core-concepts) which includes setup prerequisites.

## Notes

- Examples use `nginx-gateway` as the GatewayClass name - adjust for your implementation
- TLS examples require valid certificates (create Secrets first)
- Some examples are implementation-specific - check your Gateway provider's documentation
- Examples are for learning purposes - adapt security and configuration for production use
