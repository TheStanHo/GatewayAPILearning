# Gateway API Learning Documentation

Welcome to the Gateway API learning path! This documentation is designed to help you understand Gateway API by comparing it to Nginx Ingress Controllers, which you may already be familiar with.

## Learning Path

Follow these documents in order for a progressive learning experience. Start with the basics and work your way up to advanced topics.

### 📚 Start Here (Basics)
1. **Introduction** - Learn what Gateway API is and why it exists
2. **Core Concepts** - Understand GatewayClass, Gateway, and HTTPRoute
3. **Basic Routing** - Learn hostname and path matching

### 🚀 Intermediate Topics
4. **Advanced Routing** - Header, query parameter, and method matching
5. **Traffic Splitting** - Weighted routing and canary deployments
6. **TLS/SSL** - Certificate management and TLS configuration

### ⚙️ Advanced Topics
7. **Request/Response Modifications** - URL rewriting and header modifications
8. **Policies** - Policy attachments and advanced features

### 📖 Practical Guides
9. **Migration Guide** - Step-by-step migration from Nginx Ingress
10. **Best Practices** - Recommendations and best practices

## How to Use This Documentation

- Each document includes **side-by-side comparisons** with Nginx Ingress Controllers
- **Code examples** are included inline in each document
- **Working examples** are available in the Examples section
