# Nginx Ingress Equivalent - TLS Configuration
# Compare with gateway-tls.yaml
# In Nginx Ingress, TLS is configured in the Ingress resource
# In Gateway API, TLS is configured in the Gateway resource
#
# Related Documentation: Documentation/06-tls-ssl.md

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: tls-ingress
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  # TLS configuration in Ingress resource
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - example.com
      secretName: example-tls
  rules:
    - host: example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-service
                port:
                  number: 80

# Key Differences:
# 1. Nginx Ingress: TLS in Ingress resource
#    Gateway API: TLS in Gateway resource (centralized)
# 2. Nginx Ingress: Each Ingress can have different TLS config
#    Gateway API: TLS configured once at Gateway, shared by HTTPRoutes
# 3. Nginx Ingress: Certificate management per Ingress
#    Gateway API: Centralized certificate management
# 4. Gateway API: Better for multi-tenant scenarios
#    Gateway API: Clearer separation of infrastructure (TLS) and application (routing)
